PyDockStats is an easy and versatil Python tool that builds [ROC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) (Receiver operating characteristic) and [Predictiveness Curve](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-015-0100-8) curves.

The script starts creating a logistic regression model from the data, and with the predictions it creates the graphical plots. ROC curve is a graphical plot that describes the performance of a binary classifier by plotting the relationship between the true positive rate and the false positive rate.
PC (Predictiveness Curve) curve is a graphical plot that measures the ability of a Virtual Screening program to separate the data in true positives (true active) and false positives (decoys) by plotting a [Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function). Therefore, the tool is useful when verifying Virtual Screening programs' performance and gaining more confidence when making inferences.

## Getting Started

The development version can be installed directly from github via `git`:

```git clone https://github.com/molmodcs/PyDockStats.git```

The source is the "pydockstats.py" which generates the Predictiveness curves and ROC curves given a dataset of decoys and ligands with their respectives IDs or names, docking scores (decimals separated by dot (.) ) and their activities (0 or 1). The script is compatible with any number of programs. The input data (.csv, .xlsx, .ods) must be separated into columns for each docking program:

|id_program1|scores_program1|activity_program1|id_program2|scores_program2|activity_program2|
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
|molecule1  |-12.3          |0                |molecule4  |3.6            |0                |

Example:

|surf_id                                                                                    |surf_scores|surf_actives|icm_id   |icm_scores|icm_actives|vina_id  |vina_scores|vina_actives|

OBS: The molecules of the programs doesn't need to be align, because the algorithm sort them for each program and the alignment will be lost.
